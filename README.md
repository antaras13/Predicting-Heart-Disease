# About The Project
In this project, I aimed to predict heart disease by analyzing a medical dataset with key attributes like age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more, applying machine learning algorithms to classify the likelihood of heart disease.

Key steps included:

Model Development: I developed and evaluated two machine learning models, Naive Bayes and Decision Tree, to predict the presence of heart disease.
Correlation Analysis: Analyzed the relationships between key attributes, uncovering moderate positive and negative correlations that provided insights into significant health indicators related to heart disease.
Model Performance:
The Naive Bayes model achieved an 85% accuracy, with a ROC AUC score of 0.92, Precision of 88%, Recall of 85%, and an F1 Score of 86%.
The Decision Tree model was further optimized to achieve an 87% accuracy, with a ROC AUC score of 0.88, Precision of 86%, Recall of 88%, and an F1 Score of 87%.
This project allowed me to strengthen my skills in model evaluation and optimization, while gaining valuable insights into heart disease prediction using machine learning techniques.
